<p>This is a static website built with <a href="https://harpjs.com/">HarpJS</a> and served magically on <a href="https://surge.sh">Surge</a>.</p>

<h2>Who This Repo is For</h2><p>This repo is mostly for me. I host my code on GitHub for reasons of portability, ease of work, and peace of mind.</p>
<h2>Useful commands</h2><h4>Harp Server</h4><p>Running a Harp as a server or multihost is the primary purpose of the tool. This command is designed to run and serve a single app located on your computer.</p>
