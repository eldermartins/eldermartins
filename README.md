This is the source code of my personal website. Here I can play with the stuff I'm learning and have the freedom to test, improve and write.

This is a static website built in [HarpJS](https://harpjs.com/).

## Who This Repo is For

This repo is mostly for me. I, like many of you, host my code on GitHub for reasons of portability, ease of work, and peace of mind.

## Useful commands


#### Harp Server
Running a Harp as a server or multihost is the primary purpose of the tool. This command is designed to run and serve a single app located on your computer.
```
harp server [my-harp-blog]
```

#### Compile
Export your harp site to flat static assets â€“ HTML / CSS / JavaScript.
```
harp compile
```
